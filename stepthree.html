 			<div class="instructionThree">Finally, we can use two different ways to press botanicals: the wooden press or books. Both have their advantages, and can make beautiful pressed plants. <br> <br>
 			WOODEN FLOWER PRESS:
 			<ol class="listThree"><li>Cut two pieces of plywood; drill holes in each board.</li>
			<li>Layer flowers between two pieces of paper and wood.</li> 
			<li>Use wingnuts and bolts to tighten everything together.</li> 
			<li>Blotter papers will need to be changed every four days or so; press plants for 3-4 weeks.</li>

			<div class="columnTwo">
			BOOK PRESS:
			<ol class="listThree"><li>Use heavy books, like dictionary or phone books. Use a book you don’t mind wrinkling, the moisture being absorbed has that affect.</li>
			<li>Layer the flowers between paper.</li> 
			<li>You may be able to press multiple flowers in one book. Space flowers out, so the moisture doesn’t transfer between flowers.</li> 
			<li>Weigh down book with weights, other books or even a brick.</li>
			<li>Change blotter papers every few days. Flowers will be dry after 2-3 weeks. Remove flowers with tweezers.</li>

						With this stage, we are looking for plants that are sturdy and either just bloomed or ending their time. Freshness is the key to ensuring a long-lasting final result. If possible, make sure to find botanicals that are freshly fallen, or directly cut from a garden. When picking from a garden, the best time to cut flowers or plants is the morning after dew has evaporated. Flowers will naturall flat faces are easiest to press, due to their natural fold.
